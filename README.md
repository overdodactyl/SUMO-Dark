# Usinge Bugzilla-Dark

Copy and paste the contents of `Bugzilla_Dark.css` into an extension such as [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

Set the style to Apply on `URLs on the domain` `bugzilla.mozilla.org`.

Once the theme is more finalized, I will host it on https://userstyles.org/ and most likely include it in ShadowFox[https://github.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox].
